<h2>11 September 2021</h2>
<h3>Written by Garrett Ramos</h3>
<hr>
<p>In a Spurs performance that can only be described as woeful, to say the least, Tottenham Hotspur suffered defeat at Selhurst Park by a score of three goals to nil. Crystal Palace, led by the Ivorian international, Wilfried Zaha, were courageous in their attacking play, taking the risks necessary to warrant all three points up for grabs in the match. Tottenham on the other hand, failed to get out of first gear it seemed, recording only two shots in the match, their lowest total in the Premier League since August of 2005 against Blackburn Rovers.</p>
<p>Not much occurred in the first half apart from Spurs centre half Eric Dier departing due to injury early on, and then Connor Gallahger’s point blank effort saved by Spurs shot stopper Hugo Lloris amidst a crowded six yard box right before the break. Palace did well to find a firm foothold during the latter stages of the first half, dominating possession, and stifling the likes of Spurs’ Harry Kane on the other end. Tottenham looked in need of some creativity higher up the pitch, and I was rather surprised when both Tanguy Ndombele and Bryan Gil remained on the bench as the teams returned to the pitch for the second half.</p>
<p>While the first half lacked a bit of spark, the second half quickly came to life after a Japhet Tanganga foul on Wilfried Zaha brought the two teams together for an exchange of pleasantries. What was key to note from the brief dust up was the yellow card Spurs’ Tanganga received as a result, because just minutes later Tanganga would receive his second caution following a late lunging tackle which concluded the young defender’s day on the pitch. While Spurs created close to nothing prior to Tanganga’s dismissal, going down to ten men ended almost all hope of the team creating any further opportunities. It was all Crystal Palace following the red card, with Zaha continuing to run riot down the left side, terrorizing the Tottenham right back, debutant Emerson Royal. The breakthrough eventually came from the spot, after Palace’s Gallagher attempted a ball into the box, only to be denied by the arm of Spurs’ Ben Davies, who notably came on following Tanganga’s second yellow card. Zaha expertly dispatched the penalty, casually rolling the ball down the middle of the goal, sending Lloris diving to his right. Palace continued to apply pressure to the floundering ten men of Spurs, where the introduction of new signing Odsonne Edouard saw the former Celtic forward score his first Premier League goal just 28 seconds into his debut. Zaha muscled his way into space on the left side, beating Emerson Royal before drilling a ball into the path of Edouard who in his first two touches of Premier League football slotted the ball into the bottom right corner to make it 2-0 to Palace. Edouard would add to his Premier League tally with the last kick of the match, scoring once again on his left foot after finding himself in acres of space in the 18 yard box at the conclusion of a quick Palace counter attack. In the end, even when the team’s were level on men, Palace looked the better side. It was always going to be a difficult match away from home for a Tottenham side missing the likes of Heung-Min Son, Steven Bergwijn, Davinson Sanchez, Christian Romero, and Giovani Lo Celso from their traveling squad. But I don’t think many envisioned a performance as pitiful as what we all witnessed from this Tottenham side, regardless of who was unavailable. Tactically, Nuno Santos will have to be better, both in preparation, and in game. As for the players, they will know that more is expected of them going forward.</p>
<h3 style="font-size: 40px;">Player Ratings</h3>
<h4>Hugo Lloris - 6</h4>
<p>Lloris did well to keep Spurs in the match with a point blank save on Connor Gallagher at the end of the first half. The one notable save aside, I couldn’t really fault the skipper on any of the three Palace goals. That being said, conceding three in any match, in any context, is never going to result in an individual performance worthy of any accolades. </p>
<h4>Emerson Royal - 4</h4>
<p>The former Barcelona man made his Tottenham debut against Crystal Palace starting at right back. It is safe to say that many supporters will not come away from the match overly inspired by Emerson’s performance, especially in regards to the Brazilians defending capabilities. Wilfried Zaha consistently got the better of Emerson, and offensively, he was not any better, struggling to offer much going forward, while turning over possession on more than one occasion in dangerous areas.</p>
<h4>Eric Dier - NA</h4>
<p>Came off injured ten minutes in.</p>
<h4>Japhet Tanganga - 3</h4>
<p>The main headline for Spurs from the match was Tanganga’s sending off after receiving his second yellow card in the 58th minute. I didn’t think Tanganga was all that poor prior to his sending off, but at the end of the day there really isn’t much else to say about a performance from a player who sends his team down to ten men.</p>
<h4>Joe Rodon - 5.5</h4>
<p>After coming on for the injured Eric Dier, I thought Rodon was initially quite solid. He made a couple of crucially brave blocks, which stopped what looked to be sure goal bound efforts. On the third goal which Palace scored, however, I do have to put a great deal of blame on the Welshman, who left Odsonne Edouard wide open in the middle of the penalty area after being drawn to the ball for some miraculous reason. It was a classic case of ball watching, and an example of yet another Spurs defender showcase their inability to detect the inevitable danger man.</p>
<h4>Ben Davies - 4</h4>
<p>Ben Davies was the other substitution made by Nuno Santos came on following the dismissal of Japhet Tanganga. To be blunt, Davies was quite poor during his time on the pitch, where he did not wait long to concede a penalty with his outstretched arm. The penalty concession aside, even on Palace’s second goal, I have to attach some blame to Davies, who similar to Rodon on the third goal, failed to find Odsonne Edouard in the penalty area until it was far too late. In the Welshman’s defense, his experience at centre-half in a four back defense is limited, and unfortunately, it showed. </p>
<h4>Sergio Reguilon - 6</h4>
<p>One of the better Spurs performers from a match with almost no positives, I thought Reguilon was solid defensively, with a clever headed clearance off the line as the main highlight from his day. While decent defensively, Reguilon struggled to get involved going forward, and while I can’t exactly attribute this to his own doing, I thought that when he was on the ball, he was sloppy, often rushing many of his decisions, leading to multiple turnovers.</p>
<h4>Harry Winks - 5</h4>
<p>I don’t have too much to say about the performance of Harry Winks because it seems to be the same old story with him in this Spurs team. He simply doesn’t have enough of an impact on the match on either side of the ball. Defensively he was often lost, and when in possession, there was rarely any serious ball progression.</p>
<h4>Oliver Skipp - 5</h4>
<p>Very similar to my thoughts on Harry Winks, Skipp, too, failed to have any impact on the game. I thought he was rated a little high for his rather average performances so far this season, but he has nowhere to hide after today’s match. The Tottenham midfield was thoroughly dominated by the likes of Connor Gallagher and Crystal Palace, and much of that has to be attributed to Skipp’s struggles in the middle of the pitch for Spurs.</p>
<h4>Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg - 5</h4>
<p>In a midfield trio that saw the Dane play in the most advanced role of the three, it looked from the very onset to be a tactical decision destined for failure. As much I, alongside many supporters, rate Hojbjerg, he simply isn’t the same player higher up the pitch. Spurs struggled to progress the ball forward, and unfortunately without a true creative, offensive minded midfielder in the team, that role fell to Hojbjerg, who simply wasn’t up to the task.</p>
<h4>Dele - 6</h4>
<p>I think given the Tottenham team selection, there was a sense of desperation and nagging need for Dele to showcase the utmost of his creative ability in this match, and while we never really witnessed much of that flair and creative spark we were once so accustomed to seeing from him, there were some certainly positive things on display. Dele continues to reinvent himself under Nuno Santos as a true box to box midfielder having showcased great work rate over the opening four matches of the Premier League season. Unfortunately, much of that work rate was witnessed on the defensive end in a match that, as I alluded to before, was desperately calling out for yet another moment of brilliance from Dele against Crystal Palace in the final third.</p>
<h4>Lucas Moura - 7.5</h4>
<p>Easily Spurs’ best player on the day, the Brazilian was electric at times slaloming through Palace defenders on more than one occasion. He was the only Tottenham player who looked even remotely dangerous during the match, showing a strong willingness to run at defenders at pace. Without much support, Lucas’ bursting runs led to nothing, but at least it led to a good bit of viewing occasionally.</p>
<h4>Harry Kane - 5</h4>
<p>Perhaps the most disappointing performance, in a match not short of agonizing disappointment, was none other than star man, Harry Kane. The forward was very much uninvolved in any of the few spells of offense Spurs were able to muster over the course of the 90 minutes. With no real width offered in the perplexing narrow formation which Spurs opted to line up in, Kane had no reliable service. Unfortunately, it is not the first time Kane has failed to live up to the billing with Heung-Min Son out of the lineup.</p>
