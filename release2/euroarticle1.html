<h2>19 June 2021</h2>
<h3>Written by Garrett Ramos</h3>
<hr>
<p>Matchday one at Euro 2020 has concluded and already there is much to discuss and dissect in further detail. I decided to take a look at a few of the more intriguing score lines from the first round of fixtures, including Turkey-Italy, Netherlands-Ukraine, Spain-Sweden, and France-Germany. Before getting underway I would like to give a special shoutout to Slovakia who I did not have time to include in this particular piece but I thought were fantastic, and very well organized against Poland. </p>
<h4>Turkey 0-3 Italy</h4>
<p>One of, if not the most impressive performance of matchday one came from the Italians in the tournament opener against Turkey. Conversely, Turkey simply failed to show up, disappointing from a team that many nailed down as a potential dark horse in this tournament. It is somewhat difficult to provide Italy with the full extent of praise that they deserve simply because of how truly poor Turkey was. Coming into the tournament with talent throughout the squad, Lille’s Burak Yilmaz and Yusuf Yazici and Milan’s Hakan Çalhanoğlu all had strong performances over the course of their club’s seasons and yet, did little to dictate the match against Italy. Even with the undoubted talent to be able to compete with the likes of Italy, the Turks came out timid and looked to be playing for a 0-0 draw from kickoff. With a Mourinho-esque tactical setup, the obvious talking point following the match was the fact that Turkey finished with zero shots on goal. Yet, it was more than just the lack of shots, and lack of chance creation because teams have set up similarly and mustered results off the counter attack like Turkey intended. Rather, on the attack, Turkey advanced the ball with no pace of play, and without numbers. Creative players such as Çalhanoğlu and Cengiz Under struggled to move the ball quickly in transition which limited the potential for Turkish counter attacks. Part of this difficulty needs to be attributed to Turkey’s personnel, who while a talented bunch, are not the most athletic in terms of raw pace. Experienced forward, Burak Yilmaz, had a fantastic season for Lille, as mentioned earlier, scoring 16 goals in Ligue 1, but at 35, is never going to threaten defenses running in behind. When Under came on as a substitute, he injected a much needed bit of pace into a side that wanted to hit on the counter attack from the start. However, the one time Under was able to get behind the defense, he did so alone, with minimal support from his teammates who seemed reluctant to move in transition at the speed required to threaten Italy’s defense. It looked like a tactical setup that was simply never going to work from the very beginning for Turkey, who never once looked like a threat. Without the desire to move at pace, and as a unit, Turkey’s only chance at a positive result was a 0-0 draw, a result which Italy ensured would not happen. </p>

<p>Still, a lot of credit has to be given to Italy and the performance the team put in. It is never an easy task for a team to break down an opposition sitting in such a low block like Turkey did, but Italy provided a masterclass on how to do so with their quick combinations and wide play. The Italian midfield was fantastic even without arguably their best midfielder in Marco Verratti. Still, the midfield trio of Jorginho, Nico Barella, and Manuel Locatelli dominated the match, providing endless energy, suffocating Turkey’s outlet attempts while pressing high up the pitch. It was Italy’s midfield and fullbacks, particularly Leonardo Spinazzola who were aggressive offensively, willing to gamble and get up the pitch and provide options to combine with the Italian forwards. Spinazzola’s constant overlapping and willingness to get involved in the final third was overwhelming for the Turkish defense who even while sitting in a low block found it near impossible to cope with the pace and quickness at which Italy attacked with. At the same time, the overlapping fullbacks added a layer of much needed width and support to Italy’s attack, allowing the likes of Italian forwards Lorenzo Insigne and Domenico Berrardi to find themselves in great 2v1 attacking opportunities stretching the Turkish defense and forcing mistakes like Merih Demiral’s second half own goal. While a lot has been made about Turkey’s abysmal display, and bizarre tactical setup, Italy looked as if they could beat any team in the tournament with their performance. With the perfect mix of experience and youthful athleticism, this Italian team looks poised to make a real run in this tournament.</p>

<h4>Netherlands 3-2 Ukraines</h4>
<p>The Netherlands came into Euro 2020 with a lot of question marks resulting from a string of subpar performances leading up to the tournament. The talent which this squad possesses is undeniable, but many have questioned Frank de Boer and his tactical approach, due in part to his stubborn insistence of playing three in the back, a system the players have struggled to adapt to. However, the first 70 or so minutes of their tournament opener against Ukraine seemed to answer all of those pre-tournament questions, as the Dutch opened up to a convincing 2-0 lead following goals from Gigi Wijnaldum and Wout Weghorst. While they had previously struggled to perform under the 3-5-2 setup, the Dutch looked comfortable in this match, and Denzel Dumfries excelled in his right wing back role, earning man of the match honors. Patrick van Aanholt, the Dutch left wing back also looked strong in his role, providing width and constant overlapping runs. While Dumfries was wreaking havoc on the right side getting in behind the Ukrainian defense, the Dutch midfield consisting of Gigi Wijnaldum, Frenkie de Jong and Marten de Roon looked just as strong. Gigi Wijnaldum played in a much more advanced position than what many are accustomed to seeing him play for Liverpool. Typically employed as a deep lying playmaker of sorts under Klopp, Wijnaldum played more of an attacking midfield role against Ukraine, a decision which de Boer got absolutely right. Wijnaldum’s above average athleticism, and strong work rate, combined with Frenkie De Jong’s similar traits made life very difficult for Ukraine and their attempts to play out of pressure. Similar to Italy’s midfield, Frank de Boer employed two high motor, highly technical midfielders in Wijnaldum, and De Jong, who were well complimented by de Roon’s anchoring role in the defensive midfield. The Dutch midfield looked cohesive, and if the Dutch are to make a deep run in this tournament, they will rely on their midfield to apply pressure high up the pitch with the help of their wingbacks who continually created chances on offense while also suffocating Ukraine’s outlet passes when they tried to play from the back.</p>

<p>Ukraine really never tested the Netherlands’ previously fragile three man backline and so it was difficult to tell how well the Dutch will be able to cope with teams who run well in transition, and use the width of the pitch more effectively. In particular, while the Dutch benefited greatly as a result of their high pressing wing backs, there is still the potential for exposure on the counter attack. So, without a true sample size against stronger opposition, it is difficult to evaluate the Dutch moving forward, especially because of their historical struggles under de Boer’s current tactical setup.</p>
<p>While Ukraine thought they had clawed back to earn a point against all odds prior to Denzel Dumfries late winner, there were still some positives to takeaway from their performance. Andriy Yarmolenko provided that individual moment of brilliance that every team is going to need at some point in order to advance in this tournament. Obviously, if Ukraine is hoping to rely on 30 yard wonder goals to scrape through into the knockout rounds then they might as well pack their bags right now. However, what they can hope to rely on are set pieces like the free kick whipped in by Ruslan Malinovskiy onto the head of 6’3” forward Roman Yaremchuk which resulted in the late equaliser for Ukraine. Malinovskiy, the Serie A leader in assists this past season, possesses a wand for a left foot and will be called upon for the duration of Ukraine’s tournament to put in reliable service whether from dead ball situations or open play. On the receiving end, Ukraine do have some decent headers of the ball including Yaremchuk, and like many teams in Ukraine’s position who will need to claw their way into the knockout rounds, much of their survival will be dictated by their ability to create opportunities off of set pieces.</p>

<h4>Spain 0-0 Sweden</h4>
<p>Spain entered Euro 2020 with many thinking they could make a deep run in the tournament and yet, I was skeptical. Looking at the squad selection, yes there is obvious talent throughout, but it was difficult to see where the goals were going to come from. Spanish forward Gerard Moreno is coming off a fantastic season, capped off by a Europa League Final win with Villareal, but only came on as a substitute later in the match against Sweden. The man who started in his place, Juventus forward Alvaro Morata, has all the ability in the world, but has struggled for consistent form for multiple seasons now. Against Sweden, Morata missed what looked to be a clear cut chance one on one with the keeper late in the first half. Midfielder Koke also missed multiple half chances in the first half, which once again begs the question, where are the goals going to come from? Spain did everything in their opening match but put the ball in the back of the net. It was a thoroughly dominant performance across the board for Spain and yet they could only muster a single point. Typically, in these kinds of 0-0 matches, chance creation is rare and difficult. Sweden was, as expected, sitting in a low block, hoping to catch Spain on the counter attack, holding only 14% of possession over the course of the match. In the past, we have seen teams like Manchester City hold lots of possession and completely dominate for 90 minutes but fail to find the breakthrough, struggling to break down low block opposition and create high quality chances in front of goal. However, Spain did not share this difficulty against Sweden, and were able to create more than enough chances to win the match. In the end, it really came down to the squad’s finishing ability in front of goal. Much will be made about Morata’s missed chance, but he was not the only one who had clear sights at goal. Gerard Moreno, mentioned earlier, is probably the most reliable finisher in the squad, and yet, he too saw his free header scrambled away by Swedish goalkeeper Robin Olsen late in the match. This was obviously a poor result for Spain, but it was certainly not a poor performance. This is important to make clear because if Spain were struggling to break down Sweden and failing to create chances, then that would be cause for concern. However, if Spain continue to create chances of similar quality to what they had against Sweden I do believe the goals will come. Professional footballers can only miss so many chances before their natural ability kicks in. So, it is not yet time to worry about Spain, who have two remaining matches against Slovakia and Poland, both of which Spain should be favored in.</p>

<h5>Image via The Athletic</h5>
<p>While Sweden was always going to be up against it, playing a Spanish team destined to dominate possession of the ball, I was still impressed with some of the chances they were able to create with the little possession they did have. In particular, I came into the match excited to see what Swedish forward Alexander Isak had to offer, and he did not disappoint. If it was not for Robin Olsen’s heroic clean sheet, Isak would have easily been the best Swedish performer on the day. I do not think it would be much of a stretch to say he was really a one man attack for Sweden. While he failed to live up to expectations during his time at Borussia Dortmund, he had his best season to date this past season with Real Sociedad and will be drawing attention from a number of big European clubs following the conclusion of this tournament. Against Spain, the young forward used his great athleticism to run at and in behind the Spanish defense. But, what was more intriguing to watch was his intricate footwork and technique when he set up teammate Marcus Berg in the 61st minute for what looked destined to be the match’s first goal. At 6’3”, Isak has tremendous technical ability for his size coupled with his great foot speed, making for a defender’s nightmare. It was disappointing that Berg could not finish off what was a fantastic individual effort from Isak, and what was truly a great counter attack from the Swedish team as a whole, but even with just 14% possession the Swedes created a couple of really good chances against a Spanish team who looked a little overconfident at times. Group E is very much up for grabs, and a point against Spain, no matter what the passing and possession statistics say, is massive for Sweden who we will learn a lot more about in their remaining fixtures in the group stage.</p>

<h4>France 1-0 Germany</h4>
<p>In what was the most highly anticipated fixture on match day one and maybe the group stage fixtures altogether, a Mats Hummels own goal was the only difference between the two European heavy weights France and Germany. With very few clear cut chances, the match more or less failed to live up to expectations, but there was still plenty to analyze. The French surprised many in their decision to sit deeper and welcome German possession of the ball. I think given the overwhelming talent of the French squad many expected them to control more of possession than they did, but I think it was a very smart tactical setup from Didier Deschamps and the French, who opted to try and hit the Germans on the counter. Germany is one of the few teams in this tournament who can go toe to toe with the French on the pitch in terms of talent, but what truly separates the two teams is one man, Kylian Mbappe. The French do not need 60% possession when they have the raw pace of Mbappe running after Paul Pogba through balls, a combination that very nearly worked on a couple of occasions in the match. France had the luxury of being able to put men behind the ball, maintaining a rigid defensive shape, while still having plenty of potential offense with Mbappe terrorizing an experienced, but slow German defense. So, while much of the match was spent watching Germany in possession of the ball trying to break down France’s defense, it was a rather comfortable 90 minutes for the French, who limited Germany to no real chances at goal. In the end, the French failed to score by their own doing, but did however, put the ball in the back of the net on two separate occasions only for VAR to intervene and call offsides. The second of these called back goals was dispatched by Karim Benzema who had the simplest of finishes after Mbappe was played through on goal by a Pogba through ball. This is the pattern of play I referred to earlier, and while it failed to result in a goal not overturned by VAR against Germany, it is a sure bet to continue threatening opposition defenses for the duration of the tournament. Pogba’s elite range of passing was seriously impressive and a joy to watch given his struggles with Manchester United in the past. I have always rated his technical ability, but all too often for United we have seen a Paul Pogba who simply does not look interested in playing. For France however, Paul Pogba has always been up to it, and his performance against Germany was his best performance I have seen since the World Cup in Russia. While Mbappe and Pogba were the two obvious performers for France, I was equally impressed by midfielder N’golo Kante and defender Raphael Varane for France. While France looked more dangerous when on the attack, the Germans still did well to apply constant pressure forcing France to defend for long periods of the match, and so it was important that the likes of Kante and Varane were up to the task. Kante’s performance was impressive, and not surprising given his recent form. Varane, however, I had many questions about entering the tournament. He spent a large chunk of his club season at Real Madrid sidelined by injury, and when he was healthy, I thought he looked error prone, and unreliable, especially without Sergio Ramos at his side. Against Germany however, Varane looked confident on the ball, even while under pressure from Germany’s high press. His athleticism, too, which I never doubted, was put on full display both with his aerial ability and pace while defending.</p>

<p>Germany was good, but not nearly good enough to earn a result against the world champions. I have always been a fan of the three in the back formations, but I just did not see enough from Germany to warrant its deployment moving forward in the tournament. I was skeptical as soon as I saw the team sheets and saw Joshua Kimmich in the right wing back role. While he has experience there, and the clear ability to play the role, Kimmich is just too good to not be in the middle of the park for Germany. Kimmich was one of Germany’s most influential players against France but was limited due to being isolated to the right side of the pitch. It would be a genuine shame to see one of the world’s best midfielders designated to a right wing back role, so I can only hope Joachim Low will make the necessary changes as the tournament progresses. While Kimmich did his best to influence the match, Germany’s front three failed to rise to the same challenge. Kai Havertz, Serge Gnabry, and Thomas Muller failed to present the French defense with any real difficulty. I would not go as far as to say all three were poor so to say, but rather just not threatening. Unfortunately, against a team like the French, Germany could not afford to have their front three lacking potency. Timo Werner and Leroy Sane injected a much needed bit of pace and energy and certainly helped matters, but Germany struggled all match against the deep lying French defense. Germany did well to press high and force France to play more direct, but when they recovered the ball the pace of play just was not there. With no true number nine between Muller, Gnabry, and Havertz, the trio was always going to have to rely on fluidity, and strong off the ball movement between themselves, which I figured would greatly suit both Muller and Havertz and their tendencies. However, there really was not a lot of movement off the ball, at least not at the pace or dynamism required to give France any issues. Havertz, who I thought started to really excel at Chelsea late in the season in a more free flowing role, never really got into the match like I expected. Muller was equally absent, with Gnabry the most central of the three struggling for service much of the match. I would not be surprised to see more of Timo Werner in the next fixtures, even potentially starting. Much has been made over the last six months about his subpar finishing, grossly underperforming his expected goals tally in the Premier League for Chelsea, yet, he is one of the best players in the world when the ball is not at his feet. His runs in behind defenses not only stretch opposition backlines, but constantly pave space for his teammates to operate with great effectiveness. I am not saying Werner would have been the answer against France had he started the match, but his impact was noticeable, and against teams who decide not to sit as deep as France, Werner can and will be a real handful.</p>
