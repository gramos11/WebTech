<hr>
<p>Euro 2020’s first round of the knockout stages did not fail to live up the billing. In some of the most entertaining matches I have ever been lucky enough to witness, we saw not one, but two of the tournament’s favorites knocked out in spectacular fashion. With both France and the Netherlands out, all eyes are on those responsible for their early exit. Can Yan Sommer and the Swiss pull off another massive upset against the Spanish who just narrowly avoided an upset themselves? Or, will it be the Czech Republic to pull off another stunning victory, when they come up against a Denmark side who managed to make it look easy in their round of 16 matchup against Wales? There is so much to unpack heading into the Euro 2020 quarterfinals, so let’s get into it.</p>
<h4>Switzerland v Spain</h4>

<p>After coming away victorious in two of the most entertaining matches of Euro 2020, both Switzerland and Spain are no stranger to the pressure which their quarterfinal matchup presents. There might not have been a single person on this earth who saw Switzerland getting past the world champions, France, and yet, here they are. After taking an early 1-0 lead, the Swiss looked poised to make it 2-0 after earning a penalty just over five minutes into the second half. However, Ricardo Rodriguez’s spot kick was well saved by French keeper Hugo Llloris, igniting a ferocious French comeback, where just minutes later Karim Benzema had turned the scoreline on its head, making it 2-1 France after two well taken goals. Paul Pogba would make it 3-1 with a spectacular strike, and it seemed to all those watching that France had booked their ticket into the quarterfinal of Euro 2020. But, just five minutes after Pogba’s wonder goal, the Swiss would fire back through Haris Seferović with his second goal of the match and then once more through substitute Mario Gavranović who’s equaliser sent the National Arena into a frenzy and the match into extra time. The Swiss would eventually prevail, against all odds, when young superstar Kylian Mbappe’s miss from the spot would prove enough to seal France’s fate in a penalty shootout.</p>
<p>Spain played in a match that was arguably just as entertaining as the Swiss’s heroics against France. While Spain made sure there was no underdog triumph to be witnessed in their round of 16 matchup against Croatia, it certainly looked in doubt for a period. An Unai Simon error led to a bizarre Spanish own goal that was, to the Spanish goalkeeper’s great fortune, attributed to midfielder Pedri, putting Croatia up 1-0. The rest of the match looked to be all Spain, who were in complete control, dominating all facets of the game as they opened up to a convincing 3-1 lead following Ferran Torres’ 77th minute goal. Just like the feeling after France’s Paul Pogba’s goal, the match felt done and dusted between Spain and Croatia, but just like the Swiss, Croatia had other plans. Spain’s 3-1 lead quickly evaporated during the latter stages of the match. The incredible comeback was capped off by substitute Mario Pašalić who found Croatia’s late equalizer in the 92nd minute, forcing extra time. While Croatia seemed to have all the momentum entering extra time, Spain found a way to regain control in the match, finding their newfound dominance rewarded by two more goals, the first, which would prove to be the winner, scored by none other than forward Alvaro Morata.</p>
<p>Morata’s strike was not only important in the context of the match, but also in the context of Spain’s tournament hopes. While much fuss was made about Spain’s results during the group stage, the quality on display in those matches is not debatable. Spain has been the most thoroughly dominant team, performance wise, out of any team at this tournament. However, their inability to consistently put away the high quality chances which they create, and their fragility at the back, has left a Spanish side, otherwise dominant, still vulnerable to defeat. This is why Spain can only hope Morata’s latest strike can make way for a new wave of confidence. If the Juventus man can return to form, Spain does not look likely to lose. They have been that good. However, as we know, that is a big if. Morata, who has struggled for consistency for many seasons now, needs to somehow find it within himself to play at the level we all know he is capable of. That being said, there are other players who Spain will be counting on to find the back of the net against Switzerland. Ferran Torres is a player who, while young, has a proven eye for goal and I am expecting a big performance from the Manchester City forward against the Swiss. Switzerland is going to sit back and try to hit Spain on the counter just like they did against France. It won’t be a surprise to see Spain hold upwards of 60% of possession, and yet, I think the Swiss will be comfortable to cope with this. With the pace and power possessed by forward Breel Embolo to stretch a susceptible Spanish defense, the Swiss will have opportunities to catch Spain by surprise. The form displayed by wing back Stefan Zuber has been influential to Switzerland’s success, and I genuinely think if Switzerland is going to shock the world once more, it will have to be by the doing of Zuber. Wing back play has been the story of Euro 2020, and Zuber’s performances have been no exception. If Zuber can find space during the rare opportunities of Swiss possession and get Embolo or Seferović involved in the final third, Switzerland are in with a chance. Spain has looked uncomfortable defending the counter attack at times, especially when dealing with crosses into the penalty area. With the physical nature of Switzerland’s forwards, I think the Spanish defense could be in store for a difficult task. While Switzerland certainly has the makeup to cause yet another upset at this tournament, I believe Spain’s quality will prevail. No team has been able to stop Spain from consistently creating high quality scoring chances. It will just be a matter of Spain finding that finishing touch, which I think they will.</p>
<p style="font-style: italic;">Prediction: Switzerland 0-2 Spain</p>
<h4>Belgium v Italy</h4>

<p>In a highly anticipated affair against Cristiano Ronaldo’s Portugal, Belgium came away with the victory thanks to Thorgan, yes, Thorgan Hazard’s spectacular knuckling effort. Amongst the star studded Belgium side including Thorgan’s own brother, Eden Hazard, it was the lesser known Thorgan to provide the breakthrough. In a game of few chances, Portugal struggled to break down the more defensive Belgium, and apart from Raphaël Guerreiro’s shot off the post late in the match, Portugal failed to ever truly test Belgium’s Thibaut Courtois. It was not the most convincing performance from the side ranked number one in the FIFA world rankings, and they will have to improve against an organized Italian team without the likes of both Eden Hazard and Kevin De Bruyne who have both already been ruled out due to injury.</p>
<p>With that in mind, Italy’s performance against Austria was also less than convincing, to say the least. If it was not for VAR finding a mere few inches between Austria’s Marko Arnautovic and Italy’s last man, Italy would have been sent home packing. Unable to find a goal in normal time, Italy did well to come alive in extra time, thanks to substitutes Federico Chiesa, and Matteo Pessina who both found the back of the net for the Italians. While Austria fought back and found a goal themselves late on in extra time, the Italians prevailed. Chiesa’s impact was undeniable, and throughout the tournament, Chiesa has been a handful for defenses in the minutes he’s been given. As good as Italy’s front line has been at this tournament, I still find it hard to believe Chiesa comes off the bench against Belgium. Chiesa was simply fantastic for Juventus this past league campaign, looking at times like their best player. (Yes, better than Ronaldo) Chiesa has carried that form into Euro 2020, looking like Italy’s best player in his time off the bench. It is unclear whether Italian manager Roberto Mancini will actually alter the starting eleven in favor of Chiesa, especially given the run of form this Italian side has mustered, but there is no doubt in my mind that Chiesa will not only find the pitch against Belgium but he will also have an impact.</p>
<p>Without De Bruyne in Belgium’s midfield, I think the Italians will have a big advantage in the middle of the park. Similar to how Denmark made Belgium’s deep lying playmakers uncomfortable, I think Italy’s midfield will look to press higher up the pitch in a similar fashion. That being said, as I predicted earlier last week, Manuel Locatelli made way for Marco Verratti in the midfield against Austria, and with that, as good a player as Verratti is, the Italian midfield lost an important facet of physicality and athleticism, a trait which I thought made Italy look especially dangerous during the group stages. Besides the lack of physicality, generally I just did not think Verratti was very good against Austria. He just seemed behind the pace, but with a lot of credit due to Austria, who I thought did a good job at pressuring Verratti and forcing him to defend in uncomfortable situations in transition. Against Belgium, Italy’s midfield, including Verratti will have to be a lot better, regardless of De Bruyne’s absence. As by far the best athlete in the Italian midfield, Nicolo Barrella will have to be superb, and he will have to limit the time and space of Belgium’s playmakers. For Belgium, Romelu Lukaku will need to step up. An aging Italian defense will have their work cutout for the physical specimen that is Romelu Lukaku. I anticipate Italy controlling more possession which will make Belgium’s attacks all the more valuable, meaning Belgium’s clinical ability will be of the utmost importance. Belgium’s attack should have plenty of pace besides Lukaku with Yannick Carrasco and Dries Mertens likely to get into the team. Belgium will have to be lethal on the counter attack, or else they will once again be relying on a moment of magic from the likes of Thorgan Hazard. I hate to peg a team down due to one player being out injured, but when that player is as influential as Kevin De Bruyne it is so difficult to see the team the same way. In this tournament alone, Belgium has looked like a completely different team with De Bruyne on the pitch. He completely turned the game on its head against Denmark when he came on at halftime, and then turned in another great performance against Finland. Belgium is beyond talented, and while the loss of De Bruyne would certainly end almost any other team’s hopes of advancing, Belgium still have the resources to defeat a strong Italian side. This one can easily go either way, and I anticipate a very close match with a lone goal likely to separate the two sides. That said, I am going to go out on a limb and say Belgium will pull it off behind a Romelu Lukaku goal.</p>
<p style="font-style: italic;">Prediction Belgium 1-0 Italy</p>
<h4>Czech Republic v Denmark</h4>

<p>The other big shock from Euro 2020’s round of 16 came from the Czech Republic when they knocked off the Netherlands 2-0 after a Matthijs de Ligt red card took all the air out of the Dutch side. Even at 0-0, Czech Republic looked comfortable as they stifled the Dutch attack, holding the Netherlands to not even a single shot on goal. Obviously the match completely changed after the Netherlands were reduced to ten men, but there is still a lot to be said about Czech Republic and the danger they pose advancing further into this tournament. For starters, Patrik Shick added another goal to his tournament tally, as he continues to prove himself as a threat that needs to be taken seriously by oppositions. Shick does most of his work off the ball, cleverly finding pockets of space, as all good strikers do, in order to put his fine finishing ability on display. While not the most physically imposing player, even given his stature, his teammates will certainly cover that aspect of the game for him. The rest of the Czech side, led by West Ham midfielder Tomáš Souček, are one of the most physically daunting sides left in the tournament. This Czech side is looking to press aggressively and run oppositions into the ground, which they did very effectively against the Netherlands, rushing their playmakers into poor decisions and winning tackles in the middle of the pitch. In the build up to their second goal against the Dutch, Czech midfielder Tomáš Holeš burst into the play, following a headed goal kick, to beat Gini Wijnaldum to a 50/50 ball before passing the ball across the goal face for Shick to slot home. This was a perfect display of the athleticism and high pressing nature that this Czech side is going to offer against Denmark in the quarterfinals.</p>
<p>It will be interesting to see how things shake out between the two sides, because Denmark too, has shown a willingness to play an up tempo style, pressing oppositions into mistakes throughout the tournament. Against Wales, Denmark was at their absolute best, coming away with an impressive 4-0 victory. While Wales were probably equally as poor, it is impossible not to enjoy the way in which Denmark go about their football. The Danish play fantastic, lively attacking football, and while it is always fun to watch energetic teams who love to score goals, it does not always translate to results. Yet, the Danes are winning, and winning big, which makes Denmark’s story all the much better. Factor in this Danish side doing this all without their leader, and best player Christian Eriksen, and everyone around the world is hoping this story has another chapter in its tale.</p>
<p>Denmark is going to have a difficult matchup against the Czech Republic because while Denmark has been able to outrun teams in the past this summer, I believe the Czech’s will be right up to the task. Both teams have good athletes in the middle of the park, and the Czech’s will certainly have the edge in terms of physical presence with Souček and Holeš in the Czech midfield. However, technically, Denmark is superior, and this is important when it comes to the pace of play at which I suspect this match to be played at. Denmark like to play quickly, but that does not mean they are going to play long and direct. Denmark has been very effective when using the width of the pitch, quickly switching play and utilizing their wing backs on the attack. I’ve said it once and I’ll say it again, wing back play has been THE story at this summer’s tournament. In Denmark’s case, Joakim Mæhle has been unbelievable down the right side, and his role in Denmark’s attack will be crucial to breaking down a well organized Czech team. No matter how quickly the Czech’s look to press the ball, no man in the world is quicker than the ball, and Denmark’s quick distribution and pace of play will make it difficult for the Czech Republic to impose their physicality like they did against the Netherlands. It will be a tight contest, but I am riding with the Danes.</p>
<p>Prediction: Czech Republic 1-2 Denmark</p>
<h4>Ukraine v England</h4>

<p>Football is coming home! That is what many will be feeling after England’s sensational 2-0 result against Germany. All joking aside, England put on a professional display against a German side that looked to have no answer to England’s well versed defense. Add a favorable run to the final at Wembley, and it’s easy to see why the enthusiasm behind the Three Lions is back in full force. So much has been said about Gareth Southgate in the past, and with the announcement of England’s starting eleven prior to kickoff, even more questions were raised. England lined up with a five man defense with two holding midfielders in Kalvin Phillips and Declan Rice, and as great as Bukayo Saka was against the Czech Republic on matchday three, Jack Grealish’s exclusion from the side left many in dismay. The feeling before the match, looking at the team sheet, was that England were going to try and bore Germany to death instead of intending to win a football match. Yet, it has to be said that Southgate got his tactics exactly right. A lot of credit has to be given to the man after all the criticism he has received because England’s setup not only completely stifled a lifeless German attack, but also provided enough opportunities on the other end to snatch the goals they needed to grab the win. Part of what made this setup so effective was the more advanced position of Luke Shaw, who was thoroughly fantastic down the left side, providing England’s most dangerous attacking outlet from his left wing back position. England’s first goal came from Shaw’s teasing ball into Raheem Sterling, and I think everyone watching just knew it had to be that man to score. While Southgate has gotten his fair share of criticism, Sterling has been the victim of media abuse for years now, with many calling for him to be dropped from the side from the tournament’s onset. So, it was only right that Sterling was able to silence those calling for his head, when he scored the eventual winner. Harry Kane then sealed the deal with a clever headed finish as the result of a Jack Grealish cross to make it 2-0 late in the match leaving no path back for a shell shocked German side. While Grealish was designated to coming off the bench again, he still had his say in the match, and was impactful from the minute he stepped on the pitch, playing a part in both England goals. While I, like everyone, would prefer to see the talented Grealish start matches for England, Grealish’s impact as a super sub was undeniable, and it is so difficult to discredit Southgate for his usage of the Aston Villa man when he is getting all of the right results. Whether he starts or not, Grealish has been fantastic for England. Similar to Chiesa for Italy, Grealish is more than good enough to start for his respective national side, yet is just as capable of impacting the game coming off the bench. In a tournament full of tiring bodies late into the summer, a pair of fresh legs off the bench, as quality as Jack Grealish’s, are a massive asset for a team like England. </p>
<p>England’s quarterfinal opponent, Ukraine, surprised me with an extra time result, winning 2-1 against a talented Sweden team. In a game that was a lot more even than I expected, Ukraine was given a big lifeline when Sweden was reduced to ten men following Marcus Danielson’s red card minutes into extra time. Ukraine took control of proceedings thereafter before netting their winner late on in the 121st minute through Artem Dovbyk’s strong header. Manchester City’s Oleksandr Zivchenko was Ukraine’s best player on the night, scoring Ukraine’s first goal with a sizzling half volley, before assisting Dovbyk’s winning goal. Interestingly, Ukraine manager, and Chelsea legend Andriy Shevchenko opted not to start midfielder Ruslan Malinovskiy against Sweden. While he did come on as a substitute later in the match, a player as talented as Malinovskiy will surely return to the lineup against England. Ukraine were certainly missing that bit of quality in possession prior to his introduction, and I think given Malinovskiy’s ability to whip in dangerous crosses from set plays, it will be even more important for him to be on the pitch in a matchup against England where Ukraine should expect little possession, and few chances apart from set pieces.</p>
<p>If Ukraine are to pull off the upset against England, not only are star men Zivchenko and Malinovskiy going to have to be at their absolute best, but forward Roman Yaremchuk is going to have to be a lot better than he was against Sweden. Ukraine’s best chances are either going to be from set pieces or on the counter against England. Either way, it means Yaremchuk is going to have to involve himself, and he is going to have to be clinical with the few opportunities I envision Ukraine mustering. That being said, as good as I thought England was against Germany, there were a few moments where England’s defense switched off a bit, and gave the likes of Kai Havertz and Timo Werner opportunities to get in behind. While Ukraine does not have the same pace up front as Germany do, England is certainly susceptible to being caught off guard in transition, and Ukraine will have to look to exploit these moments with great precision. In attack for England, I think there are going to be dull phases of the match, where Ukraine will sit low defensively and England will operate in the slow, methodical pace of play we have been accustomed to seeing in some of England’s lackluster performances, like against Scotland. England are going to dominate the ball, and Ukraine are going to be fine with that if England are going to be passive like they were against Scotland. England have to use their width like we saw against Germany, but more importantly their pace of play needs to be quicker. They need to play with a higher tempo, in terms of finding the quick combinations at the top of the box, and finding the overlapping wing backs out wide to put in low driven crosses. England welcomed Germany as the aggressor in their round of 16 matchup, and I think that better suited their tactical setup. However, against Ukraine, this is not going to be the case, England are going to control the pace of the game, and they will have to be aggressive in their pursuit of an opening goal, because the longer the match remains scoreless, the more time Ukraine will have to find a foothold in the match and start looking for a winning goal themselves. It is no secret that England are big favorites in this quarterfinal matchup against Ukraine, but England has struggled to break down defensive opposition at Euro 2020, and so, I envision another difficult task for the Three Lions. That being said, I think they will manage a narrow result, and we will see England one step closer to bringing football home. </p>
<p style="font-style: italic;">Prediction: Ukraine 0-1 England</p>
