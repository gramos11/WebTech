<h2>22 September 2021</h2>
<h3>Written by Garrett Ramos</h3>
<hr>
<p>
    After Tottenham started the match superbly, with Tanguy Ndombele opening the scoring and Harry Kane soon after doubling the lead, the home side, Wolves, did well to battle back, eventually tying the match in the 58th minute through Daniel Podence. Both teams had good chances to find a winner in what was a thrilling affair, and yet, the match would end up going to penalty kicks following the 90 minutes. Spurs would prevail in the shootout by a score of 3-2, after Connor Coady hit the crossbar with his spot kick for Wolves. Harry Kane, Sergio Reguilon and Bryan Gil would all score, with Pierre-Emil Hojbjerg as the only Spurs player to miss from the spot. Pierluigi Gollini would also make a crucial save in the shootout, helping to book Tottenham’s ticket into the next round of the Carabao Cup.
</p>

<h3 style="font-size: 40px;">Player Ratings:</h3>
<h4>Pierluigi Gollini - 6</h4>
<p>The Italian shot stopper conceded twice in the 90 minutes, and did not have too much action apart from that. Besides making one poor pass out of the back into the stands, there wasn’t much I could fault him for. In the penalty shootout, Gollini made one crucial save, after coming agonizingly close to saving the first of Wolves’ spot kicks.</p>
<h4>Japhet Tanganga - 5</h4>
<p>I thought Tanganga had a decent first half, going strong into his tackles, and making great bursting runs into the final third on a couple of occasions. However, in the second half, the young defender made a few sloppy errors on the ball, leading to Wolves’ counter attacks, and defensively, Tanganga too often resorted to committing fouls rather than play defense, a byproduct of his physical play.</p>
<h4>Cristian Romero - 5</h4>
<p>On the second goal, which Spurs conceded, I felt like Romero could have done better to defend the ball into Wolves’ Podence. The lazy dangle of the right leg simply was not good enough for a defender Spurs paid a hefty price tag for. Apart from that, I would generally say it was an average performance, and relative to my expectations for the Argentine, I would even go as far as to say it was a poor performance for Romero, who was responsible for at least three terribly lazy giveaways over the course of the match. </p>
<h4>Davinson Sanchez - 5</h4>
<p>After a relatively quiet first half for the Colombian, the second half quickly started with Davinson Sanchez getting turned inside out, after a horrible attempt at a tackle on the winger for Wolves. It was a sight that was no stranger to any Spurs fan who has watched Sanchez over the last couple years. While he has seemingly improved since last season, tonight was not the Colombian’s best work.</p>
<h4>Ben Davies - 4</h4>
<p>The Welshman offered absolutely nothing to the Spurs attack tonight. Defensively, Davies was not nearly as poor, but at the same time, multiple Spurs players made sure to help out defensively down that left flank to avoid Wolves’ Adama Traore making a mockery of Davies one on one.</p>
<h4>Oliver Skipp - 7</h4>
<p>All things considered, I felt like this was Skipp’s best performance this season for Spurs. He did very well in the holding midfield spot, facilitating play, and beating defenders on the dribble when he had to. Defensively, Skipp was immense, winning the ball back in crucial areas to set up numerous Tottenham counter attacks, including the attack which led to Ndombele’s opening goal.</p>
<h4>Tanguy Ndombele - 6</h4>
<p>If there was a match to perfectly capture the enigma that is Tanguy Ndombele, it would be this one. The Frenchman is very clearly one of the best players on the pitch in every match he plays in, as he showed tonight when he opened the scoring for Spurs. However, there are too many occasions where he simply switches off and loses focus. Unfortunately, Ndombele had a direct fault leading to both Wolves’ goals tonight, which counteracts an otherwise dominant performance in the middle of the park. On the first goal, his level of effort is simply unacceptable, allowing Dendoncker to easily score off the corner kick. On the second goal, it is another occasion where Ndombele has taken one too many touches in an area of the pitch where he knows the ball needs to be played. With a player of Ndombele’s ability, sometimes you just have to take the bad in stride, for all the moments of brilliance he provides, like today’s opening goal.</p>
<h4>Dele - 6</h4>
<p>Dele showed some genuine improvements from this past weekend, in terms of being more involved in the final third, and in the build up play. Even though he superbly assisted Kane for Spurs’ second goal, I thought there were too many times where Dele gave away the ball too carelessly. As an attacking player these kinds of risks were part of what made him so great, but now, playing in a more balanced role, he needs to remove the turnovers from his game, which have killed off too many attacks this season for Spurs.</p>
<h4>Giovani Lo Celso - 4</h4>
<p>It was another poor performance for Lo Celso, who was the first to come off for Spurs in the 61st minute. The Argentine was once again in some tremendous position both on and off the ball to impact the game, but struggled to find the quality required in the final third on a number of occasions. In the first half, he cleverly got in behind the defense before cleverly beating Wolves’ last man, only to trip over the ball one-on-one with the keeper. I am still a genuine believer in Lo Celso’s ability, but he needs to start finding some consistency in his performances.</p>
<h4>Bryan Gil - 8 (MOTM)</h4>
<p>My man of the match, the young starlet, Bryan Gil was superb. The Spaniard was Spurs’ most dangerous player for great portions of the match. He nearly scored his first goal for the club, if not for a superb sprawling save from Wolves’ keeper, John Ruddy. Apart from that, Gil demonstrated an immense work rate, running at defenders on both sides of the pitch, and tracking back to make a couple of great challenges, most noticeably on Adama Traore. Definitely one for the future, Bryan Gil gave us a glimpse of what to expect in his best performance for Spurs to date.</p>
<h4>Harry Kane - 7</h4>
<p>After a shocking performance against Chelsea on the weekend, it was important that Kane bounced back to regain some domestic form. It was surely a big confidence boost to get on the scoresheet after scoring Spurs’ second goal, but it was also really good to see Kane getting on the ball as often as he did today, after struggling for touches over the course of the last two Premier League matches. I still want to see Kane get more touches in the box, and in more dangerous areas, but today’s performance was a major improvement from what I’ve observed from the forward this season.</p>
<h4>Heung-Min Son - 5</h4>
<p>After coming on for Lo Celso with about a half hour to play, Son had an almost immediate impact after putting in a scintillating cross into the box, finding Harry Kane, who had his header brilliantly saved by the Wolves keeper. Apart from that, however, Son was really quite poor, and struggled to give the Tottenham attack that lift many were looking for. </p>
<h4>Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg - NA</h4>
<p>Came on for Dele in the 82nd minute.</p>
<h4>Sergio Reguilon - NA</h4>
<p>Came on for Japhet Tanganga in the 97th minute.</p>
