<h2>19 September 2021</h2>
<h3>Written by Garrett Ramos</h3>
<hr>
<p>In a match that ended like many expected, it was a disappointing evening for the home side, Tottenham, who looked like the better side going into the break. Unfortunately, after a bright start to the match, Spurs simply didn’t show up after halftime. Thiago Silva opened the scoring for Chelsea after getting on the end of a corner kick just 5 minutes into the second half. After that moment, any belief that the team could go on to score seemed to leave all of the Tottenham players, because it wasn’t much longer until N’Golo Kante would make it 2-0 after seeing his deflected shot go in off the inside of the post. In fairness to Spurs, up to that point, I didn’t feel like Chelsea had done a great deal to break down Tottenham’s defense, and yet, the home side found themselves in a 2-0 hole. Chelsea had certainly started the second half on top, dominating the run of play, but in terms of creating genuine goal scoring opportunities, I think Tottenham’s defense would have been proud of their work to minimize the opposition’s chances. A set piece and a massive deflection just about sealed the match for Chelsea, and it is not too harsh to say that many of the Tottenham players gave up chasing the match at that point. The last 10-15 minutes of the match saw Chelsea muster a number of goal scoring opportunities from close range. At this point, it was only a matter of time before Chelsea added a third goal to their tally, and so, it was no surprise when Antonio Rudiger made it 3-0 late on. While the visitors dominated proceedings in the second half, the score line will feel a bit harsh to the Tottenham defense in my opinion, who I felt played well enough to stick in the match. That being said, Tottenham’s attack was not at all up to grade. After not being clinical or anywhere near lethal enough in the final third in the first half, the Tottenham attack failed to turn up in the second half, with Harry Kane and Heung-Min Son ghosting for much of the second 45.</p>
<h3 style="font-size: 40px;">Player Ratings</h3>
<h4>Hugo Lloris - 6</h4>
<p>Similar to the performance against Crystal Palace last weekend, I cannot really fault the skipper for any of the three goals conceded today. Lloris dealt with everything he was meant to and in the end, was rather unfortunate to see three shots end up in the back of the net.</p>
<h4>Emerson Royal - 5</h4>
<p>Emerson Royal’s matchup, this time Marcos Alonso, seemed to get the better of the Brazilian once again this weekend. Defensively, Emerson made some strong tackles, but positionally, allowed Alonso too much space to operate in. Offensively, Emerson failed to impact the match, especially in the second half. Apart from one clever outside of the boot cross onto the head of Lo Celso very early into the match, Emerson’s role in the attack was non-existent.</p>
<h4>Cristian Romero - 7</h4>
<p>On the field for two of the goals conceded during the match, and yet, I genuinely didn’t think Romero put a foot wrong in his first Premier League start.</p>
<h4>Eric Dier - 6.5</h4>
<p>With Romelu Lukaku as Eric Dier’s main opposition, the Englishman had his work cut out for him, and yet he did fantastic containing Lukaku for much of the match. Similar to Romero, Dier was unfortunate to end the match with three goals conceded, in my opinion. Dier did make one outstanding goal line save at some point during the match, but that being said, on Chelsea’s second goal, I would have liked to see a better effort from the center back, who looked to stick out a lazy dangle of the leg to deflect Chelsea’s N’Golo Kante’s shot in off the post.</p>
<h4>Sergio Reguilon - 5</h4>
<p>One of Spurs’ best chances in the match came when the ball was at the Spaniard’s feet in the first half. Bearing down on goal, Reguilon delayed just enough to warrant a shot on goal rather than a low cross, which he opted for, resulting in defensive clearance from Chelsea’s Antonio Rudiger. Offensively, I felt like Reguilon had the opportunities to really impact the game, and he just didn’t quite make the right decisions. Defensively, he was a tad late tracking Rudiger out of the six yard box, which would end up resulting in Rudiger getting just the space he needed to fire Chelsea 3-0 in front. </p>
<h4>Pierre-Emil Hojbjerg - 6</h4>
<p>Not much to say for the Dane. I felt like Hojbjerg did his job on the day, and it just wasn’t enough unfortunately.</p>
<h4>Dele - 4</h4>
<p>There has been so much praise for Dele’s new and improved work rate, and all the running he does for the team, and yet at some point we have to ask for the quality to come out as well. Simply put, Dele was just not good enough, and offered almost nothing to the team today. He had a couple clever forward passes into the path of Heung-Min Son, but he also had a couple of other passes end up in the hands of spectators along the touchline. Defensively, he worked hard and did well to track back, which is definitely appreciated, but it also must be said that it was his man, Thiago Silva, who would score the match opener off of a corner kick early into the second half. Without the athleticism to beat players on the dribble that he once used to display, Dele has to impact the game with his progressive passing, a part of his game that has not improved enough to make up for his faltering athleticism. </p>
<h4>Giovani Lo Celso - 4</h4>
<p>One of the few players who had the real potential to alter the course of this match, Lo Celso was wasteful with the opportunities he found himself with. There were too many crucial giveaways in important areas of the pitch, and not to mention, the poor turnover in Spurs’ own final third which would result in Chelsea’s second goal of the match. Many supporters are ready to write off the Argentine, but anyone who watched Lo Celso over the summer knows that he has all the ability to still help this Tottenham side going forward.</p>
<h4>Tanguy Ndombele - 6.5</h4>
<p>Ndombele was arguably the best player on the pitch after the first 45 minutes. There is no question that Tottenham’s midfield is infinitely better with Ndombele in it, and the first half showed that. One can only hope that his 62nd minute substitution was fitness related, because the Frenchman had himself a very decent performance up until his departure. The occasional turnovers from his reckless trickery are well worth the moments of genius he is able to conjure, and hopefully with a good run of matches, Ndombele can make a true imprint on this Tottenham team. </p>
<h4>Heung-Min Son - 6</h4>
<p>I thought the Korean looked like the most likely source of a potential Spurs goal in the first half. Son was dynamic off the ball, with his teammates getting him the ball in behind Chelsea’s defense on a couple of occasions. However, in the second half, Son struggled to shift the tide back into Tottenham’s favor. It was a tale of two halves, like many of the Tottenham players, with Son amongst them.</p>
<h4>Harry Kane - 4</h4>
<p>It is yet another Premier League match where Harry Kane has failed to find the back of the net. But what is worse is that Kane looks completely disinterested at the heart of Tottenham’s attack. He simply had no impact whatsoever in today’s match, and this is not the first time this season that this has been the case. There is really nothing else to say other than that if Tottenham are to be successful this season, Kane is going to have to be significantly better, or else see himself dropped to the bench for someone who will at least demonstrate a bit of desire.</p>
<h4>Bryan Gil - 6</h4>
<p>After coming on as a substitute, the youngster showed some glimpses of his ability, demonstrating a willingness to run at defenders. Unfortunately, Gil is still yet to show he can contribute in the Premier League. The Spaniard is still so young, and this match time will be crucial to his development for the future.</p>
<h4>Oliver Skipp - 6</h4>
<p>Another player who came on as a substitute for Spurs, I thought Skipp played well during today’s cameo. In the time he did have on the pitch, there was nothing egregious to tarnish the young midfielder’s brief stint. </p>
<h4>Davinson Sanchez - NA</h4>
<p>Came on for Romero late into the match.</p>
