<h2>6 July 2021</h2>
<h3>Written by Garrett Ramos</h3>
<hr>
<p>Wembley Stadium played host to both Spain and Italy as the two European heavyweights faced off in the first of Euro 2020’s highly anticipated semifinal matchups. For Italy, the loss of one of the tournament’s top performers, Leonardo Spinazzola, was the big headline leading up to the match with Chelsea’s Emerson Palmieri filling in at the left side of the Italian defense. With the announcement of Spain’s lineup, the big omission was struggling forward Alvaro Morata, with Luis Enrique opting for a front three consisting of Ferran Torres, Mikel Oyarzabal, and Dani Olma who would operate in a false nine role, more or less. It was a gutsy move by Enrique, and while surprising, it was a call I really liked, regardless of its outcome. Morata’s finishing woes aside, I felt like Enrique’s revised front three would offer a greater degree of interchange between themselves in attack. Any of the three could operate effectively both centrally and out wide, which had the potential to make it very difficult for Italy’s defense in terms of tracking the movement in Spain’s attack. Italy’s lineup had no surprises, with the expectation being that the Italians would sit back and counter a fragile Spanish defense.</p>
<p>The first half was quite characteristic of what we have come to expect from this Spanish side, meaning tons of possession, and sufficient chance creation. Yet, Spain could not find the breakthrough against a tactically inept Italian side. Italy did as close to nothing, in terms of offense, that a side of their caliber can possibly muster. It was always going to be a difficult task against a Spanish side destined to dominate possession, but Italy struggled to even play out of their defensive third, and had only one shot in the first half. Italy, for lack of a better word, were horrendous, while Spain was dominant. But, as seems to be a reoccurring theme, Spain were dominant with nothing to show for said dominance. As poor as Italy were, they were still very much in the match, limiting Spain to only a couple of true half chances, both squandered by Oyarzabal. While Spain’s attacking trio were kept quiet in the first half, the Spanish midfield was led by the supremely brilliant Pedri. The teenage talent has been superb all tournament, and he was once again, far and away, Spain’s best player in the first half against Italy, failing to misplace even a single pass. Pedri’s progressive play was the main source of Spain’s threat on the attack, and his movement when off the ball was causing great confusion amongst the Italian defense. The other main component of Spain’s midfield was the experienced Sergio Busquets, who was also stellar in the first half against Italy. The game within the game, which I was looking forward to witnessing, was between Busquets and Italy’s Jorginho. While Busquets has received his plaudits over the years playing in some of Barcelona’s greatest ever teams, Jorginho has started to earn similar respect through his immaculate performances this summer. The two deep lying midfielders represent the glue holding together their respective teams, both possessing very similar roles and style of play. While Italy’s Nico Barella pinpointed Busquets as the man to stop in Spain’s team, Cesar Azpilicueta pointed to Busquet’s Italian counterpart, Jorginho, as Italy’s most influential player. Both players have the unique ability to always find the right spaces to facilitate possession for their team, always finding a way to connect passes. They do all the work that the casual audience will rarely see, and almost never acknowledge, and so, it was a battle of the two invisible men as the two faced off. However, Jorginho was maybe a little too invisible for an Italian team who were pitiful when trying to connect passes out of the back in the first half. Jorginho was simply not good enough, and it showed through Italy’s first half performance. One man who was doing his best for Italy was Jorginho’s teammate at Chelsea, Emerson Palmieri, who was doing his best Spinazzola impression, running up and down Italy’s left side. Emerson was one of the few Italian players who turned up for Italy in the first half, as his pace and attacking presence gave Italy at least a glimmer of hope that they could break down Spain’s defense.</p>

<p>Italy struggled to cope with Spain’s counter press, as Spain quickly and aggressively pursued the ball immediately following any turnover of possession. While I have already criticized Italy’s inability to play out of the back while under Spanish duress, a lot of credit has to be given to Spain and their high tempo. After a difficult first half, Italy knew they would face similar difficulty if they kept trying to play out from the back. So instead, Italy came out in the second half a lot more direct with their passing while in possession. While the first half was characterized by Italy struggling to counter attack due to their inability to find that first, break starting pass, the second half showcased a much more dangerous Italian counter attack. Spain still controlled the majority of possession, but they were now much more aware of the possibility of an Italian threat. In the tournament’s entirety, Spain’s defenders have been extremely liable in one-on-one situations. Spain’s counter press was a direct response to their fragile defense. In other words, if you don’t want your defenders defending, win the ball before your defenders ever have to defend. However, when that press is broken, and Spain’s defenders are forced to defend, they are going to have to win individual battles while defending counter attacks at pace. This is exactly what happened when Italy’s Gigi Donnarumma rolled the ball out to Marco Verrati who then quickly made the direct pass to forward Lorenzo Insigne to kickoff a lethal counter attack. Insigne’s incisive through ball was just barely blocked by a rushing back Aymeric Laporte. However, the ball fell right to the feet of Federico Chiesa who now faced only Eric Garcia on the edge of the box. Laporte had just barely won his individual battle when he stopped Insigne’s through ball into Ciro Immobile, and now Eric Garcia was caught in a precarious situation being forced to defend Chiesa one-on-one. Garcia had no chance, as Chiesa pushed the ball to his right before unleashing a curling effort to the far side of Unai Simon’s net. It all happened in the blink of an eye, as the lightning fast Italian counter attack shocked the Spanish defense. Italy were able to quickly get numbers up the pitch, creating a number of very difficult options for Spain to defend. While Insigne’s initial pass was dealt with superbly by Laporte, Spain were under too much pressure with the onrushing Chiesa able to brilliantly slotaway his chance. While Spain had controlled much of the match up to that point, you cannot say Italy’s goal was undeserved, as the Italians came out of the break with a clear improvement in execution of their initial tactical plan. At the end of the day, it was a brilliant strike from a player I have been touting for a while now. I had called for Roberto Mancini to insert Chiesa into the starting lineup prior to Italy’s quarterfinal matchup, and was delighted to see it come to fruition. Now, I am even more delighted to see the decision payoff in the form of a crucial goal.</p>
<p>Spain did very well to respond to what certainly felt like an Italian punch to the gut, returning to their prior dominance. The turning point in Spain’s comeback was definitely Alvaro Morata’s introduction into the match. While he seemed timid and lacking in confidence early on, Morata quickly emerged as Spain’s most dangerous player down the stretch. Interestingly, Morata did a really good job dropping a little deeper than we have typically seen him at Euro 2020, so that he could get on the ball in a position where he can face the goal and carry the ball forward. I thought that Morata has struggled at this tournament as a traditional number nine where he is forced to play with his back to goal. He struggled to connect with his teammates in those positions and was consistently losing possession in key areas of the pitch. However, against Italy, he was able to receive the ball in positions where he was able to utilize his good athleticism and ball carrying skills. It was no coincidence that Morata’s positioning further from the goal led to Spain’s breakthrough, as the Juventus forward was able to pick up the ball close to the midfield circle, turn and carry the ball at pace towards Italy’s goal. After getting Italian defender Georgio Cheillini to commit towards the ball, Morata played a quick one-two pass with Dani Olmo, slipping in behind the Italian defense, before cooly dispatching on his left foot from eight yards out. It was simply beautiful football from Spain who finally found a way to quickly combine in a way that forced Italy’s backline to step out of position. Morata cleverly found pockets of space throughout the latter stages of the second half and while plenty of jokes will be made at the conclusion of this tournament, Morata was certainly the difference maker for Spain, forcing extra time.</p>

<p>In extra time, Italy looked to be holding on for dear life. In the first fifteen minute stage of the extra time period, Italy faced a barrage of Spanish shots most of which were bravely blocked by Italian defenders. It looked like a sure bet that Spain would find a way to net their winning goal, and yet, it was Italy who thought they scored their second when Domenico Berrardi was able to find the back of the net, only to be called offsides shortly after. Following Berrardi’s close call, penalties became inevitable, with Italy shutting down any chance of Spain finding a winner. After a penalty shootout performance where Spain somehow prevailed after looking like they were avidly trying to lose, I had little belief in Spain this time around, especially after hearing that Luis Enrique had not elected to practice penalties during the team’s training sessions in the lead up to the match. While Italy looked to restore my belief in Spain, following Manuel Locatelli’s miss at the spot, Dani Olmo responded with Spain’s first kick of the shootout only to miss himself. Italy were then flawless until the end, with Andrea Belotti, Federico Bernardeschi, Leonardo Bonnuci and Jorginho all expertly dispatching. Unfortunately, as destiny would have it, Alvaro Morata would be the man to miss Spain’s crucial kick. Morata’s miss allowed Jorginho his moment to send Italy to the final of Euro 2020, and yet, all eyes were on the Spaniard. From zero to hero back to zero, it will be a tournament Morata will either be hoping to forget or use for motivation moving forward. Either one, I cannot help but feel for Morata who simply had his time with fate on the day. Just like Kylian Mbappe, it just was not to be for Morata from the spot, and I can wish only the best for Morata going forward. As for Italy, they now carry a national record 33 game unbeaten streak into a final where they will be met by either Denmark or England. Italy have won six from six at Euro 2020, and whoever they face in the final will have to be at their best when they come up against an Italian side who look like they forgot how to lose.</p>
